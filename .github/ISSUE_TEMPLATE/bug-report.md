### To Reproduce
Please provide a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) here. We hope we can simply copy/paste/run it. It is also nice to share a hosted runnable script (e.g. Google Colab), especially for hardware-related problems.

### Describe your attempts
- [ ] I checked the documentation and found no answer
- [ ] I checked to make sure that this is not a duplicate issue

You should also provide code snippets you tried as a workaround, StackOverflow solution that you have walked through, or your best guess of the cause that you can't locate (e.g. cosmic radiation).

### Context
 - **OS** [e.g. Windows 10, macOS 10.14]: 
 - **Hardware** [e.g. CPU only, GTX 1080 Ti]: 

In addition, figure out your version by running `import pycorrector; pycorrector.__version__`.
